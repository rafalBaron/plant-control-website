# plant-control-website

Simple project for class. I decided to make my own website instead of displaying data on poor LCD display.
Rpi configured to be the server and of course sensors reader.

Project made with:
 - RaspberryPi 2, 
 - stuff like sensors, wires, water pump and LED as a bulb substitute,
 - Python (Flask, jsonify), 
 - HTML, 
 - CSS,
 - JavaScript (AJAX).

The goal for this project is to make another, one of thousands on the internet, self watering plant. 
Not ready yet.
